        Introduction to the process and techniques of modeling physical problems, including computing strategies and analysis of results. Python programming will be emphasized. Numerical methods covered include solutions to linear and non-linear equations, solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations, finite elements, linear programming, and optimization algorithms. Prerequistes: MATH 210 and CSCI 112. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.)

      <h5 class="card-title"><a href="m240/index.html">MATH/CSCI 240: Introduction to Computational Mathematics</a></h5>
      <p class="card-text"> This course provides a survey of computational techniques and methods that are rooted in mathematics and computing. Topics covered include numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations, non-linear equations in one variable, and classification methods. Applications of the techniques to "real-life" problems encountered in economics, physics, and/or the life sciences is emphasized. Constructing computer programs to implement the techniques presented also is emphasized. Prerequisites: MATH 110 and CSCI 112.</p>
