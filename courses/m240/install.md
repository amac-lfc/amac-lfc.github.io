# MATH/CS 240

## Python

For this class we will use Python 3 and the following libraries:
* **Numpy**: a package for scientific computing.
* **Scipy**: another package for scientific computing.
* **Matplotlib**: library for plotting.

First you need to install Python 3. You can download is from the Python [Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  Be careful to download the 64-bit version of Python and also check 'pip' and <b>ADD TO THE PATH</b> when you install.
</div>


Then you can use pip (or pip3) to install the libraries. First open a terminal if you are on Mac/Linux or Windows PowerShell on Windows. In there you will have to type
<pre class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  On some system it is not pip but pip3. Test it by typing `pip --version` or `pip3 --version` to see which one works.
</div>

## Jupyter Notebook

You can install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html) Notebook or Lab with the following command in the terminal/powershell:

<pre class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">pip install notebook jupyterlab
</code></pre>

Once it is installed, you open a terminal/powershell in the folder where you want to save your files and execute the following command:

<pre class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
or
<pre class="command-line"><code class="language-bash">jupyter lab
</code></pre>
